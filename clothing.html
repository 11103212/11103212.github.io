	<p>The next generation of wearables will be able to cultivate even more data and transmit that information to health professionals </p>
	<p>with the help of 5G. Machine learning algorithms will help predict potential health issues based on the </p>
	<p>data gathered. In order to cultivate this data, we predict that wearable clothes fitted with sensors will rise in popularity,</p>
	<p> yielding ground-breaking applications in Fitness, Healthcare, Emergency Services, and Fashion.</p>
	
<h3>From gamers to dogs, Japan forges ahead in smart clothing</h3>

	<p>A virtual-reality jacket that replicates the sense of touch, a belt that predicts when a pregnant mother will go into labor, </p>
	<p>and even a vest that monitors the health of your precious pooch: these are just some of the products emerging in</p>
	<p> Japan's fast-growing market for smart clothing.</p>
