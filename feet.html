<h2>Shoe wearables – stepping into a new era for healthcare</h2>
<img src="images/image 4.png">
	<p>Connected shoe technology is a growing field with a broad range of applications, </p>
	<p>and it is set to make a significant contribution to the world of health and wellbeing over the next few years.</p>
<p> How does this revolutionary technology work, what can it be used for and what does the future look like? </p>
<h3>Pe<img src="images/image 5.png" height="171">ople with mobility issues set to benefit from wearable devices </h3>
<p>Rehabilitation is vital for patients, but according to Professor Rossiter, outcomes are hampered by a lack of easy-to-use</p>
<p> dynamic tools to help therapists accurately analyse mobility performance and devise effective programmes;</p>
<p> and as rehabilitation increasingly takes place in patients’ homes in the absence of a therapist, better ways to support</p>
<p> in-home mobility and training are needed.</p>
