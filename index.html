 <p>Over the decades, the line between human and computer has begun to blur. We have seen </p>

	<h2>wearable tech</h2> 
	<img src="images/wearablr tech in health.jpg" width="615" height="430">
	<p> One of the enterprises intensely affected by wearable technology is WearableTechnologies In Healthcare. Throughout the years, human services and medication have
		developed after some time. Because of wearable technology, the enchantment that medicine can 
	do today is getting considerably progressively more mainstream. Different application engineers are creating applications that run explicitly on wearable 
		gadgets.How Wearable Technologies In Healthcare is making Impact on our lives</p>
		
<strong>Benefits for patients</strong> 
		
<p>Wearable smartwatches are fundamentally used to screen pulse, rest examples, and the sky is the limit from there. It was developed primarily to provide patient support and benefits. This is a particularly suitable technology for people with chronic illnesses that require continuous monitoring. This makes it easier to collect medical data regularly and allows you to understand the underlying disease more accurately. You can attach the patch to your skin and receive information. Such pieces can introduce clinical information progressively to draw clear examples. The utilization of such wearable patches is an elective medical clinic confirmation if the patient should be followed at regular intervals.</p>


<strong>Medical bill</strong> 
		
<p>Traveling to the hospital takes time and money for the patient. Wearable apps and devices, developed by top app developers, were expected to reduce medical costs. This applies especially to patients with conditions that require regular assessment, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. A viable wellbeing check can likewise help the advance mind and decrease treatment expenses and difficulties.</p>
	
<h2>HOW WEARABLE SMART CLOTHING WILL REVOLUTIONIZE HEALTH, FITNESS, AND FASHION</h2>
<img src="images/image 6.jpg">
	<p>The next generation of wearables will be able to cultivate even more data and transmit that information to health professionals </p>
	<p>with the help of 5G. Machine learning algorithms will help predict potential health issues based on the </p>
	<p>data gathered. In order to cultivate this data, we predict that wearable clothes fitted with sensors will rise in popularity,</p>
	<p> yielding ground-breaking applications in Fitness, Healthcare, Emergency Services, and Fashion.</p>
	
<h3>From gamers to dogs, Japan forges ahead in smart clothing</h3>
<img src="images/image 7.jpg" width="300" height="343">
	<p>A virtual-reality jacket that replicates the sense of touch, a belt that predicts when a pregnant mother will go into labor, </p>
	<p>and even a vest that monitors the health of your precious pooch: these are just some of the products emerging in</p>
	<p> Japan's fast-growing market for smart clothing.</p>
	
	<h2>Head-mounted Voice Activated, Gesture Controlled Wearable Accessory for Mobile Devices</h2>
<img src="images/image 1.jpg">
	<p> 
	This case study brings out Mistral’s expertise in the wearable domain, conceptualising, designing and developing powerful,</p>
	<p> low power, small form factor, rugged devices that host trending and futuristic features and technologies. </p>
	<p>This case study also showcases Mistral’s proficiency in implementing Speech Recognition, </p>
	<p>Gesture Control, Noise Cancellation and UI/UX application development for wearable applications.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Wearable Devices in Education</h3>
<IMG src="images/image.jpg">
<P>Can you imagine even a day without your smartphone? Today technologies possess all spheres of our life. </P>
	<P>They are created to optimize our timetable, make some processes easier and productive, and give us more spare time for personal life. </P>
	<P>The educational sphere is not an exception and it also requires modern technologies. It is important to keep up to date your knowledge and widen your outlook.	  </P>
	<P>Students and pupils just don’t have enough spare time to receive and process the amount of information that goes from the internet.</P>
	<P> So they can use mobile or web apps to make an educational process easier and more effective.</P>
	
	<h2>Shoe wearables – stepping into a new era for healthcare</h2>
<img src="images/image 4.png">
	<p>Connected shoe technology is a growing field with a broad range of applications, </p>
	<p>and it is set to make a significant contribution to the world of health and wellbeing over the next few years.</p>
<p> How does this revolutionary technology work, what can it be used for and what does the future look like? </p>
<h3>Pe<img src="images/image 5.png" height="171">ople with mobility issues set to benefit from wearable devices </h3>
<p>Rehabilitation is vital for patients, but according to Professor Rossiter, outcomes are hampered by a lack of easy-to-use</p>
<p> dynamic tools to help therapists accurately analyse mobility performance and devise effective programmes;</p>
<p> and as rehabilitation increasingly takes place in patients’ homes in the absence of a therapist, better ways to support</p>
<p> in-home mobility and training are needed.</p>
